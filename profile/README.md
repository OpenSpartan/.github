# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to OpenSpartan

**OpenSpartan** is all about building tools to help you gain insights about your Halo experiences. From a [companion app](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/openspartan-workshop), to a tool that helps you in [resolving gamertags to XUID](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/xuid-resolver), [extract career data](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/career), and [analyze locally-stored Halo Infinite data](https://github.com/OpenSpartan/notebooks).
